# Phage lab

[![Binder](http://mybinder.org/badge.svg)](http://mybinder.org:/repo/mikheyev/phage-lab)

This is an interactive tutorial teaching the principles of next-generation data analysis using a re-sequencing experiment.

You can launch it by clicling on the "Launch Binder" badge above. This will launch Binder and build a virutal environment (takes a few minutes), after which you can interactively analyze data.

Alternatively, you can clone the repository and install the environment using the [Miniconda package manager](http://conda.pydata.org/miniconda.html).

	conda install jupyter ipython
	conda env create -f environment.yml
	jupyter notebook

This should open the same environment, but locally.
